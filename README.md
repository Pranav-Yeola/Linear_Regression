# Linear_Regression
The "train.py" file trains the linear regression model.
The "predict.py" file takes test_X.py as input and stores predicted values in "predicted_test_Y.csv" file
The training data files should be in the same directory with "train.py" and "predict.py".
The training data should be stored(in csv format) with file names "train_X_lg.csv" and "train_Y_lg.csv" files or edit the path/name of your files in the "train.py"

Run the "train.py" to train the model
then run "predict.py" with test_X file (in same format as "train_X_lg.csv") to get the output.
The correctness of output can be measured by uncommenting the validation function in "predict.py"
